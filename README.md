Using the list below, design a code that will create 3 word sentences following this logic:

1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10

The piramid above can be used to visualize how consecutive sets of numbers encrease by 1 each time but do not repeat, and only last integer of each set is used to arrange 3 word sentence. In this case, the sentence will be: " down, dont, nine".

The task:

Build a project that applies this logic to the list below and output all 3 word sentences.
